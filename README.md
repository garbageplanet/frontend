# README #

### What is this repository for?
Repository for the [garbagepla.net](https://garbagepla.net) frontend.

### How to get started?
Just open /src/index.html in your browser. If you want to build for distribution just run `npm i` to install gulp and dependencies in the root directory and type `gulp`.
To rebuild or new templates you need to install javascript-template `npm i blueimp-tmpl` then change directory to `/src/js/templates` and run the command found at the bottom of the file `tmpl_howto.html` in the same folder.
Note that if you do not have your own token for mapbox and other APIs you won't be able to build properly.
