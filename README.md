### What is this repository for?

Repository for the [garbagepla.net](https://garbagepla.net) frontend.

### How to get started?

Run `npm i` to install gulp and dependencies in the root directory and type `gulp` to build. Note that if you do not have your own token for mapbox and other APIs you won't be able to build properly.

### Tokens and external APIs

These should be in an .env file in the root folder. Look at gulpfile.js for all the required tokens.

- [ ] add direct upload of geotagged photo
- [ ] upload to imgur as user
- [ ] make the edit system
- [ ] put the build on github and deliver with jsdelivr and inject dependencies with the fetch API / https://github.com/jhabdas/fetch-inject / JAM Stack-style
- [ ] build a minimal entry point for loading the content via cdn
- [ ] navigate visible markers in the bottom panel view with https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-list-markers
