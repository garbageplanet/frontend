### What is this repository for? ###

Repository for the [garbagepla.net](http://www.garbagepla.net) frontend. This responsive layout adds a top bar for navigation and a bottom bar for displaying map feature data.

### How to get started? ###

Just open /html/index.html in your browser.

### Contributing

We don't have a build process yet, so for the moment, if you add a new feature/function, you need to manually check that it doesn't break the user interface's main functions (check the console). When adding a new js function to the code, add a comment about what it does.

If you want to cnotribute to a specific todo below, the first thing you should do is open an issue and you'll be assigned to the issue.

### TODO

- [ ] layers control fix
- [ ] map controls placement on mobile

#### Bottom panel

- [ ] vertical scroll inside each column that is independant of other columns scroll

#### Map actions
- [ ] editing system for map features with [L.Editable](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.Editable)

- [ ] make the code overall less redundant (loading forms elements and building lists for `<select>` )
- [ ] implement .getScript() for lazy loading scripts that are not required globally

#### Making the code more maintainable
- [ ] create build script with minification (closure compiler) for deployment
- [ ] cycle current public keys and add new one during build process

#### Future prospects
