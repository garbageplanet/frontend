### What is this repository for? ###

Repository for the garbagepla.net UI. This responsive layout adds a top bar for navigation and a bottom bar for displaying map feature data.

### How to get started? ###

Just open /html/index.html in your browser.

### Contributing

We don't have a build process yet, so for the moment, if you add a new feature/function, you need to manually check that it doesn't break the user interface's main functions (check the console). When adding a new js function to the code, add a comment about what it does.

If you want to work on a specific todo below, the first thing you should do is open an issue and repo owners will add you as collaborator and assign you to the issue.

### TODO
