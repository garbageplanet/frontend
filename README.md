# README #

### What is this repository for? ###

Repository for the garbagepla.net UI. This responsive layout adds a top bar for navigation and a bottom bar for displaying map feature data.

### How to get started? ###

Just open /html/index.html in your browser.

### Contributing

We don't have a build process yet, so for the moment, if you add a new feature/function, you need to manually check that it doesn't break the user interface's main functions (check the console). When adding a new js function to the code, add a comment about what it does.

If you want to work on a specific todo below, the first thing you should do is open an issue and repo owners will add you as collaborator and assign you to the issue.

### TODO

#### Bottom panel
- [ ] any media displayed in the bottom panel should take the width of its parent `<div>`
- [ ] implement templates for the contents of the bottom panel
- [ ] vertical scroll inside each column that is independant of other columns scroll

#### Map actions
- [ ] make the events markers + api routes
- [ ] implement editing system for map features
- [ ] make the map pan to follow newly created point while drawing a polyline
- [ ] make the map add new markers instead of reloading everything in the current view when map moves


### General coding, coding style, code review
- [ ] make the code overall less redundant
- [ ] implement templating for i18n
- [ ] split main.css into components-specific files

#### Making the code more maintainable
- [ ] create build script with minification (closure compiler) for deployment
- [ ] better structure/split script files
- [ ] implement .getScript() for lazy loading scripts that are not required globally

#### Future prospects

- [ ] implement bootstrap v4
