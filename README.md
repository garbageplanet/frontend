### What is this repository for?
Repository for the [garbagepla.net](http://www.garbagepla.net) frontend v. 0.1.

### How to get started?
Just open /src/index.html in your browser. If you want to build for distribution just run `npm i` to install gulp and dependencies in the root directory and type `gulp`. Note that the build script is currently incomplete.

### Contributing
All contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute to a specific todo below, the first thing you should do is open an issue and you'll be assigned to the issue.

### FIXME
- [ ] bootstrap form validation - disallow submit button until ok (not only add class `disabled` to submit button)
- [ ] load features into layer but do not re-create each layer after elements are added or removed (get_features.js) 

### TODO
- [ ] finalize the edit system (build the feature creation forms from templates)
- [ ] build the cleaned, join, play and confirm functions with a prototype
- [ ] split mobile / desktop css
- [ ] build the search widget in sidebar for mobile and in the top panel on desktop.
- [ ] allow drawing shapes but hide the sidebar on draw:start and show it on draw:created


#### Upgrade
- [ ] custom builds (Leaflet, FontAwesome, Bootstrap)
- [ ] move to leaflet 1.0 - works out of the box but fix `L.marker.menu.js` plugin menu first
- [ ] move to bootstrap 4 and make custom build with [cards](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card)
- [ ] modularize js code
